# SQL-Data-Analytics-Project--EDA
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow, covering everything from basic data exploration to advanced performance analysis. The goal was to understand the underlying structure of the dataset, identify key trends and patterns, and uncover insights that could drive informed business decisions.


Key Highlights:-
===============
•	Database Exploration: Understanding schema structure, table relationships, and data types

•	Dimension Exploration: Analysis by categories such as customer, product, and region

•	Date Exploration: Identifying trends, seasonality, and patterns over time

•	Measure Exploration: Investigating key metrics like revenue, sales, and quantity

•	Magnitude Analysis: Highlighting high vs. low-performing segments

•	Ranking Analysis: Using window functions for Top-N and comparative analysis

•	Change Over Time: Analyzing growth trends, month-over-month and year-over-year changes

•	Cumulative Analysis: Running totals and progression tracking

•	Performance Analysis: Comparing actual results against targets or benchmarks

•	Part-to-Whole Analysis: Assessing contribution of segments to the overall total

•	Data Segmentation: Creating customer or product segments based on behavior or performance

•	Reporting Preparation: Structuring data for use in dashboards and reports
